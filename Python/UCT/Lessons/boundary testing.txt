Program:
number = eval(input("enter the number"))
number = number+10

if(number<20):
	print("Small number")
else:
	print("large number")

if(number%5==0):
	print(" divible by 5")




equivalece classes:
	not divisable by 5 and small: 4
	diviable by 5 and large: 10
	diviable by 5 and small: 5
	not divisable and large: 34

boundarys:
	large number = 10,11
	small number = 9

statment coverage:(All the statments tested once)
	5 = small number and diviable by 5
	14 = large value

path coverage:(makes sure that all the paths are tested)
	5 = small number and divisable by 5
	15 = large number and divisable by 5
	4 = small number
	14 = large number
